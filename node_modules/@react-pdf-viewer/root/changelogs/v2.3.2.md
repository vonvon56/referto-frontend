## v2.3.2

**Improvements**

-   Lazy load the document. The PDF document will be loaded if the viewer container is visible in the viewport.

**Bug fixes**
Fix a bug that could happen when we load multiple documents by changing `fileUrl`.
In that case, you may see the error message

-   `Worker was destroyed`
-   `Cannot read property 'sendWithPromise' of null`

This version also fixes a potential memory leaks reported by React DevTools when we try to load new document even if the current document isn't rendered completely.
