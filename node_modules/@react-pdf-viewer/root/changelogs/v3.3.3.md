## v3.3.3

**Improvements**

-   Clicking `Enter` automatically jumps to the next match when being focused on the keyword field
-   Support documents which are optimized for web. Users don't have to wait the full document loaded to see the first page.

**Bug fixes**

-   Automatically scroll to the thumbnail of the initial page when it's set
-   The text might not be selectable if a plugin registers the `renderPageLayer` method
-   There is a page that is not rendered even it is visible when users zoom the document
