## v2.4.3

**Bug fix**

-   Clicking on an internal link jumps to an incorrect page (one page after the destination one)

**Improvements**

-   Automatically scroll to the thumbnail that represents the current page
-   Display the progress properly when printing a big document
-   Improve the performance of preparing pages for print such as using a shared `canvas` element for all pages
-   Keep showing a spinner until the canvas layer is rendered completely
-   The print plugin supports documents whose pages have different dimensions
