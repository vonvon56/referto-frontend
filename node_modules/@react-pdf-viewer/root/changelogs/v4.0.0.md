## v4.0.0 [WIP]

**New feature**

-   pdf-js v4 and later versions are now supported. However, the legacy build of pdf-js is no longer supported.

-   Compatible with React Server Components

-   Provide a new hook to set the state without worrying about whether the component is unmounted. This is useful when updating internal states after an async operator like fetching data:

```js
import { useSafeState } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

const [state, setState] = useSafeState(initialValue);

fetchData().then((data) => setState(data));
```

**Improvements**

-   Implemente a new mechanism to position portal components like Modals, Popovers, and Tooltips. If the desired position causes an overflow, the component will automatically determine the best position to ensure the layout isn't broken.

-   Up until now, pressing the Escape key would close all open popovers and modals. But we've made a change to this behavior. From now on, pressing Escape will only close the topmost popover or modal.

**Bug fix**

-   Render the initial page without loading the document completely
-   The loading spinner keeps showing forever when we enter full-screen mode

**Breaking change**

-   The `Worker` component is replaced with the `Provider` component

```tsx
// Before v4.0.0
import { Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

// v4.0.0
import { Provider } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';
```

You have to pass the instance of pdf-js to the `Provider`:

```tsx
import { Provider, type PdfJsApiProvider } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';
import * as PdfJs from 'pdfjs-dist';

const apiProvider = PdfJs as unknown as PdfJsApiProvider;

<Provider pdfApiProvider={apiProvider} workerUrl="...">
    <Viewer fileUrl="..." />
</Provider>;
```

If you have to use the legacy version, then use the corresponding import:

```tsx
import * as PdfJs from 'pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.mjs';

const apiProvider = PdfJs as unknown as PdfJsApiProvider;

<Provider pdfApiProvider={apiProvider} workerUrl="...">
    <Viewer fileUrl="..." />
</Provider>;
```
