## v2.4.1

**Bug fixes**

-   Clicking the Download button doesn't work. It only works the file when scrolling to the second page
-   Using the Default Layout plugin, we can't scroll between pages on Safari 14
-   The Open file button covers other elements, so we can't click on the Download or Print buttons. This issue only happens on Safari 14
