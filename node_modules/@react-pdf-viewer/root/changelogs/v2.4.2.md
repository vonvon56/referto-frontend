## v2.4.2

**Bug fixes**

-   Can't delete the last remaining digit in the page number input
-   Properly check whether or not the `fileUrl` changes
-   Fix the issue where we see the spinner if the document has a single page and the height is smaller than the viewer's height
-   Can't open the downloaded file if it was loaded with `Uint8Array`
-   Annotation popup can be displayed under the previous or next page
-   When users download a document loaded with `Uint8Array`, the download file is named as `document.pdf` instead of the document blob
-   Clicking a bookmark doesn't jump to the destination properly in the first time if the bookmark also requires to zoom the document to fit the width

**Improvements**

-   Display the current page number in the right
-   Make the content of annotation scrollable
-   Support shortcuts
