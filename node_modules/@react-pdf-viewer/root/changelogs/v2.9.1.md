## v2.9.1

**Improvement**

As we know, the `Viewer` component only renders the pages which are visible in the screen. For an invisible page, users will see a spinner. However, the animation used in the `Spinner` component can slow down the app if the document has a big number of pages.

This version improves the performance by animating the `Spinner` component when it's visible only.
